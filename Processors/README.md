# Processors


These processors are used to process files in the dataset. However, they are just basic examples that I used for my models. You have to modify the paths or other lines in the code files to adapt to your own project.

## Descriptions:

- Classifier.py is used for extracting data for each province from the dataset
- Converter.py is used for converting the name from a language to another
- Visualizer.py is used for visualizing the predicted data on a map or graphs
